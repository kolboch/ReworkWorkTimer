# ReworkWorkTimer
This project contains rework of existing app WorkTimer from my first tries of MVP architecture to MVVM. 
Although I improve greatly in MVP I decided to try writing the same with MVVM approach just to test and feel the difference.
Main parts of the code will be reused but some new ideas will be implemented like:
- more specific graphs or activities
- nfc binding for simplified usage
- adjust ( or remove) notification totally as they became useless in this project with Android limitations ( mainly API 23+)
